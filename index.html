        Last year due to covid I was doing virtual learning. I am in the drama club, I love theatre. Acting and singing are two of my favorite things to do. I love a lot of broadway shows and I would love to go see Dear Evan Hansen one day! My favorite subjects in school are math, web design and history! Over the summer I did a 20 hour roadtrip to Orlando Florida! That trip was one of my favorite trips I have ever been on and I had an amazing time being there with my family. We went to Disney World, Animal Kingdom and Epcot. It was my first time going to Disney since I was about one year old!</h4></div>
